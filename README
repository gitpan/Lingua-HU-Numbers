Lingua-HU-Numbers

This Perl module is used for turning numbers into it's Hungarian text
representation, for example "32" into "harminckettö".

The module requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer and has no non-core module 
dependencies.

GRAMMAR

Hungarian grammar rules state that numbers 2000 or below use no hyphen,
and above 2000 they use hyphen(s) unless the number is an integer amount of
thousands or integer amount of millions.

Numbers are divided into groups of three measured from the end of the number
and the hyphens are placed between those groups.

In the case of 100 and 1000 the textual representation of 1 - "egy" is not
written, only "száz" (hundred) and 1000 (thousand) instead of "egyszáz" and
"egyezer". This applies to numbers in the format of 1xx and 1xxx, but not
elsewhere.

There may be more quirks unimplemented - I'm not a linguist.
If you are one, correct me given that I'm mistaken in something.

(Rules of hungarian grammar).
